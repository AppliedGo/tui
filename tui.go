Want to equip your command-line application with a nice visual user interface? TUI libraries are here to help.

<!--more-->

Console applications usually take some parameters at start, and maybe some more input through basic console I/O. And that's ok in most cases, though sometimes it would be great to have a visual user interface but without the code size and complexity of a full-blown Web app.

[Text-Based User Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface) libraries (or TUI libraries) meet this need. They bring panes, input, output, mouse support, graphics, and audio, to your terminal.


## OK, so can we do a side-by-side test, please?

Unfortunately, no.

Originally, I planned to evaluate three to four TUI libraries for Go side-by-side, using a sample app definition with a specific set of features to be tested. I had a few requirements on the libraries: They should -

* be fairly complete TUI libraries, supporting flexible layouts, standard UI widgets like buttons, menus, text entry, text output, mouse support, etc.
* provide high-level abstractions (as opposed to only providing low-level UI primitives),
* be active projects (that is, the last commit should not date back to months or even years ago),
* be past the alpha stage, and
* have reasonable documentation or sample code. (No, API docs don't count. I wanted at least a simple how-to-start tutorial that covers the basics.)

Turned out that none of the libraries I found passes all of the requirements.


## So that's it? No single all-in-one, high-level GUI lib with decent documentation?

Well, not if you really want all those nifty UI features at once. However, if you can forego some of the requirements, there is indeed a small selection of capable TUI libraries at your disposal that I'll briefly introduce below.

Just one thing before we start.

The list is (and cannot) be complete. I used GitHub.com, awesome-go.com, GolangLibs.com, and LibHunt.com to find TUI libraries but still there is no guarantee that I found all relevant projects out there.

Without the tips of a couple of redditors in [this `/r/golang` thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/5zx4xb/suggest_me_your_favourite_terminal_gui_libs/), `clui` and `wm` would perhaps have slipped through.

And then, of course, the above list of criteria is a very fuzzy filter, and you might have included a library that I ruled out because of this list.

But now let's move on to the TUI library overview.


### Bare bone TUI libraries

If you are fine with building your UI on top of a handful of UI primitives, there are two libraries that look fairly stable and complete:


#### [nsf/termbox-go](https://github.com/nsf/termbox-go)

`termbox` has a small and straightforward [API](https://godoc.org/github.com/nsf/termbox-go). It uses a two-dimensional cell buffer to represent the terminal screen, with a few methods like setting cells, clearing the screen, or setting the cursor. All input, whether keyboard, mouse, or resize events, is tracked through a unified Event type.

As simple as the API might seem, it has not prevented others from creating interesting projects on top of `termbox`, including higher-level TUI libraries (`termui`, `gocui`, `tui-go` and `termloop``), simple games, [godit](https://github.com/nsf/godit) (a text editor) and [hecate](https://github.com/evanmiller/hecate) (a hex editor), and more.

The README makes no claims about supported platforms. The code includes some `syscall_*.go` files, indicating that `termbox-go` runs on Linux, macOS, Windows, OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD, and Dragonfly BSD.


##### Strengths

* A fair range of supported platforms
* Popular base TUI layer for a number of TUI projects


#### [gdamore/tcell](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell)

According to the author, `tcell` was born out of the need for certain features that `termbox-go` does not provide, and patching `termbox-go` turned out to not be a suitable way to go forward. `tcell` claims to have a couple of advantages over `termbox-go`, including [additional functionality](https://godoc.org/github.com/gdamore/tcell), better portability, better I/O, better support for mouse, Unicode, colors, and more. (I cannot comment on these claims, as I have tested neither `termbox` nor `tcell` in great depth.)
`tcell` is the TUI library behind the [Micro editor](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro/), and is also used by [godu](https://github.com/viktomas/godu).

According to the README, `tcell` works on POSIX systems that provide a POSIX termios implementation with `/dev/tty`, as well as on Windows.

The "POSIX" requirement includes Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, and Solaris, and certainly more systems that are not explicitly listed in the README.


##### Strengths

* A wide range of suppored platforms
* A rich API


### Higher-level libraries


#### [gizak/termui](https://github.com/gizak/termui)

`termui` is one of the high-level TUI's that are built on top of `termbox-go`. It is specialized on displaying information in graphical form - as bar chart, line diagram, spark line, or as a gauge. Text output is also possible of course. The UI is built on the concept of widgets, or blocks, that contain exactly one type of data representation - text, charts, or diagrams.

![termui dashboard demo](dashboard.gif)

`termui` provides a static layout and a grid layout. The grid layout can respond dynamically to resizing of the terminal window.

On the input side, `termui` offers a simple event handling system that can react to key presses, window resizes, or timers.

What is missing from `termui` to make it a "feature-complete" TUI toolkit is high-level input handling (input boxes, buttons, menus, drop-down lists etc). I also missed some sort of resizeable panes, although the grid layout probably provides a suitable alternative to that.

A couple of projects have already been built with `termui`, including [ctop](https://github.com/bcicen/ctop).

##### Strengths

* Rich set of data visualization widgets
* Flexible, resizeable 12-column grid layout


#### [jroimartin/gocui](https://github.com/jroimartin/gocui)

This library almost seems like the opposite of `termui`: No fancy widgets anywhere, but instead, building blocks for split views, overlapping views, editable views, and event handling for keyboard and mouse events.

![gocui real-life screenshot - httplab](httplab.gif)

##### Strengths

* Text input views
* Resizeable layouts via custom redraw handler


### Promising projects

I couldn't resist including the following projects here, although they do not meet  some of the inclusion criteria. Still, they look very promising and may offer one or the other feature that you might have missed in this list so far.


#### [VladimirMarkelov/clui](https://github.com/VladimirMarkelov/clui)

From the screenshots, this is perhaps the best-looking TUI library in this list. It also looks fairly advanced already, featuring a rich set of UI widgets like buttons, drop-down lists, gauges, etc. as well as a window manage and theming. However, the lack of documentation (except for the API docs) indicates that this is still a work in progress.

![clui screencast](clui.gif)


##### Strengths

* Many standard UI widgets
* Multi window capability, including resizing and overlapping


#### [cznic/wm](https://github.com/cznic/wm)

Definitely a work in progress, `wm` manages overlapping, resizeable, decorated windows with scrollable content.

![wm screenshot](tk.png)

##### Strengths

* Multiple, overlapping windows


#### [marcusolsson/tui-go](https://github.com/marcusolsson/tui-go)

The building blocks of `tui-go` are widgets and layout boxes. There seems no support for mouse-based resizing of layout boxes, but each layout box can assume one of (currently) two automatic resizing behaviors.

![tui-go screenshot](tui-go.png)


##### Strengths

* Easy layout through horizontally and vertically stacked layout boxes
* Layout automatically adjusts to changed terminal size
* Text input boxes


#### [termloop](https://github.com/JoelOtter/termloop)

This one is a special kind of TUI. `termloop` is not a general TUI library. Rather, it is a specialized toolkit for console-based games. So perhaps you won't be able to build a "standard" application UI on top of it, but you surely can make your windows make a sound when colliding! ðŸ˜‰

![termloop screenshot](termloop.png)

##### Strengths

* Support for console games


**Update 2018-01-08**

#### [rivo/tview](https://github.com/rivo/tview)

A newcomer in 2018. In order avoid having to always write UI controls from scratch, the author decided to create a package choke-full of high-level interactive controls like:

* Input forms
* Text views (multi-colored and navigable)
* Tables and lists (navigable and selectable)
* Layout managers (flex and pages)
* and more.

`tview` is based on `gdamore/tcell`.

##### Strengths

* All-in-one solution, including a comprehensive set of controls (from simple input field to complex table control), support for automatic layout, and an application wrapper.
* Powerful controls
* Intuitive API with optional support for dot-chaining of method calls (if you really want to)
* Detailed documentation with sample code, via [godoc.org API doc](https://godoc.org/github.com/rivo/tview) and [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/rivo/tview/wiki).



## Code

As always, there is some code included to try out at your end. This time, the code uses the two libraries `termui` and `gocui` for creating a minimal UI with a simple layout - similar to the layout in the `tui-go` screenshot:

* A list box with a fixed width, positioned at the left side
* A text entry box with a fixed height, positioned at the bottom
* A general-purpose output pane in the remaining area

If the library provides a text entry widget, text entered there shall appear in the output pane.

## termui

Let's start with `termui`.

`termui` organizes its content as "blocks". Blocks can be positioned using absolute coordinates, or they can be integrated into a 12-column grid layout. The grid layout allows to dynamically adjust the content's width when the user resizes the terminal window.

Right now, there is no automatic height adjustment available, but an [issue](https://github.com/gizak/termui/issues/134) has been raised to request this feature.

The test code works around this restriction by manually re-calculating the heights of the list block and the output block before re-aligning and re-rendering the UI.

*/

//
func runTermui() {
	// Initialize termui.
	err := t.Init()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalln("Cannot initialize termui")
	}
	// `termui` needs some cleanup when terminating.
	defer t.Close()

	// Get the height of the terminal.
	th := t.TermHeight()

	// The list block
	lb := t.NewList()
	lb.Height = th
	lb.BorderLabel = "List"
	lb.BorderLabelFg = t.ColorGreen
	lb.BorderFg = t.ColorGreen
	lb.ItemFgColor = t.ColorWhite
	lb.Items = listItems

	// The input block. termui has no edit box yet, but at the time of
	// this writing, there is an open [pull request](https://github.com/gizak/termui/pull/129) for adding
	// a text input widget.
	ib := t.NewPar("")
	ib.Height = ih
	ib.BorderLabel = "Input"
	ib.BorderLabelFg = t.ColorYellow
	ib.BorderFg = t.ColorYellow
	ib.TextFgColor = t.ColorWhite

	// The Output block.
	ob := t.NewPar("\nPress Ctrl-C to quit")
	ob.Height = th - ih
	ob.BorderLabel = "Output"
	ob.BorderLabelFg = t.ColorCyan
	ob.BorderFg = t.ColorCyan
	ob.TextFgColor = t.ColorWhite

	// Now we need to create the layout. The blocks have gotten a size
	// but no position. A grid layout puts everything into place.
	// t.Body is a pre-defined grid. We add one row that contains
	// two columns.
	//
	// The grid uses a 12-column system, so we have to give a "span"
	// parameter to each column that specifies how many grid column
	// each column occupies.
	t.Body.AddRows(
		t.NewRow(
			t.NewCol(3, 0, lb),
			t.NewCol(9, 0, ob, ib)))

	// Render the grid.
	t.Body.Align()
	t.Render(t.Body)

	// When the window resizes, the grid must adopt to the new size.
	// We use a hander func for this.
	t.Handle("/sys/wnd/resize", func(t.Event) {
		// Update the heights of list box and output box.
		lb.Height = t.TermHeight()
		ob.Height = t.TermHeight() - ih
		t.Body.Width = t.TermWidth()
		t.Body.Align()
		t.Render(t.Body)
	})

	//

	// We need a way out. Ctrl-C shall stop the event loop.
	t.Handle("/sys/kbd/C-c", func(t.Event) {
		t.StopLoop()
	})

	// start the event loop.
	t.Loop()
}

/*
That wasn't too difficult, was it? Text entry is missing here, as `termui`
has no input controls yet. Still, implementing an input box is possible with
the available API methods; see the `_example` subdirectory in `termui`'s repository. It is just too much code for this blog article, so I leave this as an exercise to the reader.

## gocui

Now let's see how `gocui` solves the same task.
*/

	g.Cursor = true

	// The GUI object wants to know how to manage the layout.
	// Unlike `termui`, `gocui` does not use
	// a grid layout. Instead, it relies on a custom layout handler function
	// to manage the layout.

	// Here we set the layout manager to a function named `layout`
	// that is defined further down.
	g.SetManagerFunc(layout)

	// Bind the `quit` handler function (also defined further down) to Ctrl-C,
	// so that we can leave the application at any time.

	if err != nil {
		log.Println("Could not set key binding:", err)
		return

## Conclusions from the code

Both libraries have their pros and cons. The `termui` code seems more concise, but this might be due to the lack of an editing feature (that would have added some lines of code), and perhaps also due to the grid layout engine that made the resize handler a two-liner.

The `gocui` layout is certainly more flexible but the tradeoff is increased code size. Text input only needs a few lines of code in `gocui`, whereas data visualization is where `termui` shines.

I leave the decision to you; maybe you even prefer to go low-level with `termbox` or `tcell`, or you might decide to give the other TUI libs a try.


## How to get and run the code

Step 1: `go get` the code. Note the `-d` flag that prevents auto-installing
the binary into `$GOPATH/bin`.

    go get -d github.com/appliedgo/tui

Step 2: `cd` to the source code directory.

    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/appliedgo/tui

Step 3. Run the binary with either "termui" or "gocui" as a parameter.

    go run tui.go termui
    go run tui.go gocui


**Happy coding!**
